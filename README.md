# Cowrie SSH Honeypot Deployment

A complete guide and implementation for deploying a Cowrie SSH honeypot on virtualized Linux infrastructure for threat intelligence gathering and attack pattern analysis.

## 📋 Overview

This repository contains all resources needed to deploy a production-grade SSH honeypot using Cowrie, capture real attack data, analyze attacker behavior, and implement automated threat response mechanisms.

**Project Status:** ✅ Complete & Operational

---

## 🎯 Features

- ✅ **Full Honeypot Deployment** - Complete setup guide from VM creation to operational honeypot
- ✅ **Real Attack Capture** - JSON-formatted logs capturing credentials, commands, and session details
- ✅ **Automated Threat Response** - fail2ban integration for automatic attacker IP blocking
- ✅ **Threat Intelligence** - Geolocation analysis, credential patterns, attacker behavior classification
- ✅ **Forensic Capability** - TTY session recordings for complete attack playback
- ✅ **Comprehensive Documentation** - Step-by-step tutorials, quick reference guides, troubleshooting

## 🔍 Log Analysis

### Analyze Attack Logs

```bash
# Count total events
cat ~/cowrie/var/log/cowrie/cowrie.json | wc -l

# Extract attacker IPs
cat ~/cowrie/var/log/cowrie/cowrie.json | jq -r '.src_ip' | sort -u

# Top attempted usernames
cat ~/cowrie/var/log/cowrie/cowrie.json | jq -r '.username' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn

# Top attempted passwords
cat ~/cowrie/var/log/cowrie/cowrie.json | jq -r '.password' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn

# Commands executed
cat ~/cowrie/var/log/cowrie/cowrie.json | grep "command.input" | jq -r '.input'
```

### Run Analysis Scripts

```bash
# Comprehensive analysis
python3 scripts/cowrie_analyzer.py ~/cowrie/var/log/cowrie/cowrie.json

# Generate visualizations
python3 scripts/visualize_attacks.py ~/cowrie/var/log/cowrie/cowrie.json

# Create daily report
python3 scripts/daily_report.py
```

---

## 🎯 Use Cases

1. **Threat Intelligence Gathering** - Understand attacker behavior and techniques
2. **Security Training** - Learn about attack patterns in controlled environment
3. **SIEM Integration** - Forward logs to centralized monitoring
4. **Credential Harvesting** - Understand password selection patterns
5. **Incident Response Practice** - Analyze and respond to captured attacks
6. **Research** - Study botnet behavior and malware campaigns

---

## 🔐 Fail2ban Integration

### Monitor Threat Response

```bash
# Check jail status
sudo fail2ban-client status cowrie

# View banned IPs
sudo fail2ban-client status cowrie | grep "Banned IP"

# Unban specific IP
sudo fail2ban-client set cowrie unbanip 192.168.1.100

# View fail2ban logs
sudo tail -f /var/log/fail2ban.log
```

### Configuration

Edit `/etc/fail2ban/jail.d/cowrie.local`:
- `maxretry` - Number of attempts before ban (default: 3)
- `findtime` - Detection window in seconds (default: 3600 = 1 hour)
- `bantime` - Ban duration in seconds (default: 86400 = 24 hours)

---

## 📈 Scalability & Production Deployment

### For Production:

1. **Deploy Multiple Honeypots** - Across different geographic locations
2. **Integrate with SIEM** - Forward logs to Splunk, ELK, or Wazuh
3. **Automate Analysis** - Run scripts on schedule
4. **Share Intelligence** - Send IoCs to threat communities
5. **Monitor 24/7** - Maintain continuous operation
6. **Add Services** - Deploy honeypots for FTP, HTTP, Database
